# Mobile Robot Navigation Techniques Comparison 

Overview of the prosidure:

1. While all the sensors are outputing the data to ros AND cartographer is running within 2D slam mode an Innitial bag file is recorded.

2. The Innitial bag file is filtered to contain only the required TF frames. This step produces the Filtered bag file.

3. Filtered bag file is used to play sensor data that is selectively fused to produce localisation information. This is then compared to the cartographer localisation output and performance evaluation is evaluated.

# 1. Hardware Setup:
2PCs are involved:
 - REF PC: Reference computer that is connected to YDLidar, Realsense d435i
 - TEST PC: PC that is connected to motor drivers and to hokuyo lidar

REF and TEST PC are connected to eachother through LAN connection, where REF PSs network is configured to IPv4 Method: Shared to other computers

TODO picture of the setup.

Both PCs have:
 - ROS: Kinetic
 - Linux: 16.04

# 2. Software setup

Look in each individual workspaces READMEs to setup each PC (TEST and REF)

# 3. Commands needed to collect the Innitial bag file with

TODO collect everything together in a launch file (now not for debugging purposes)

## On REF PC:
